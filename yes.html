        <h1>heheh i knew it baeee i loveee youuuuuuuuuuuuuu</h1>
        <p> You have no idea what this means to me. The world just became brighter, my heart fuller, and my soul at peace. I’ve always known, deep down, that this is where I belong—with you, forever. Now, with you by my side, I can’t wait to spend every day proving just how much I love you.

            From this moment onward, I promise to cherish you in every way possible. I’ll be the person who holds you close when you’re cold, who celebrates your victories with a love that knows no bounds, and who is there to catch you if ever you fall. Your happiness will be my mission, and I’ll make sure that you feel loved every single day, in ways that will make your heart overflow.
            
            We’ll laugh together, dream together, and grow together. Every adventure, big or small, will be sweeter with you by my side. I’ll listen to your thoughts, support your dreams, and be the rock you can always lean on.
            
            You’re not just a part of my life—you are my life now, and everything I do will be for you, to make you the happiest you’ve ever been. Thank you for saying yes. This love, this journey, is just beginning, and I will spend forever showing you just how beautiful it is.</p>
